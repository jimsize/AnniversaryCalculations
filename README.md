# AnniversaryCalculations
Calculate the days, weeks, and months since Annelies and Jim were married.

This is a project to remind me of extra ways to celebrate being with Annelies other than the once-a-year anniversary. It calculates the number of days, weeks, and months since our wedding date. It can send reminders by email, SNS, or just printing to stdout. I may explore other communication options in the future.

The main functionality is in anniversary.py. There is a configuration template, and some bash scripts to help with using this in AWS Lambda.
